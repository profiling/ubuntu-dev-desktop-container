# Agent Workflow Rules

- Work in small, incremental changes each round.
- Every response must include:
  - Verifiable acceptance commands (one per line, copyable).
  - A rollback method for the changes made that round.
- Avoid expanding scope; only touch files explicitly requested.
- Keep instructions and outputs concise and actionable.
